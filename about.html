      <h3>About us:</h3>
      <p>
        Our company is a major procurer of salted and dried Far East (bracken)
        fern.
        <br /><br />
        We have been harvesting ferns since 2014. Over the years, we have gained
        considerable experience in the harvesting process and learned the ins
        and outs of the procurement across the Russian Far Eastern region as
        well as across Northern, Southern, and Central Russia.
        <br /><br />
        We harvest ferns in the environmentally pristine area near a taiga
        village which stands by the mountain river Khor in Lazo district in the
        Khabarovsk region (the Far East of Russia). Collecting and harvesting
        are carried out in one place, therefore it takes less than 8 hours
        between fern collection and salting. The short processing time ensures
        that the fern’s valuable properties will be preserved. Our ferns have a
        green color and a pistachio aroma, which indicates that we carefully
        follow the salting procedure. Our ferns preserve their valuable
        properties and taste after processing and have an appealing appearance
        <br /><br />
        Fern harvesting begins every May or June. The ferns are held in a
        concentrated salt solution three times. This procedure ensures maximum
        quality and increases the shelf life of the fern from 1 to 2 years. It
        is recommended to keep the storage temperature constant, which is not a
        problem as salted fern can be stored at a temperature range between
        -30°C and + 30°C. We can procure from 30 to 100 tons of fern annually.
        We supply salted ferns in 20 kg plastic food containers and smaller
        packaging. Dry fern is supplied in 3 kg carton boxes.
        <br /><br />
